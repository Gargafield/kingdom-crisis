# Kingdom Crisis

You are the unfortunate minister that chooses political-economic policies. Can you save the kingdom in these unstable times?

## Description

Kingdom Crisis is a terminal-based financial toy-simulation made with [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) as a school project. The equations and formulas used in the simulation are by no means accurate or realistic, but they give a general idea of what economic policies can do to a country.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3. Run `cargo build --release` in the project directory
4. Run `./target/release/kingdom-crisis` to start the game

## Usage

The game is using arrow keys to navigate and enter to select. You can navigate through the menus and select the policies you want to apply, and the variables you want to see in the graph view.
